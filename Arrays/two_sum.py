Two Sum Problem Solution

Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum using hash map.
Two approaches: basic and optimized single-pass implementations.

Example: [2, 7, 11, 15], target=9 â†’ [0, 1] (indices of 2 and 7)

    Find two numbers that add up to target using hash map approach.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list[int]): Array of integers
        target (int): Target sum to find
        
    Returns:
        list[int]: Indices of the two numbers that add up to target
        
    Algorithm:
        1. Create hash map to store numbers and their indices
        2. For each number, calculate complement (target - num)
        3. If complement not in hash map, store current number
        4. If complement found, return indices of both numbers
