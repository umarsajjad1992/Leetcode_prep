Number of Islands Problem Solution

Find the number of islands in a 2D grid using BFS traversal.
An island is a group of connected 1s (land) surrounded by 0s (water).

Example: [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]] â†’ 2 islands

    Count the number of islands in a 2D grid using BFS.
    
    Args:
        grid (list[list[int]]): 2D grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water
        
    Returns:
        int: Number of distinct islands
        
    Algorithm:
        1. Iterate through each cell in the grid
        2. When finding unvisited land (1), start BFS to mark entire island
        3. Use BFS to visit all connected land cells (4-directional)
        4. Count each complete island traversal
        
    Time: O(m * n), Space: O(m * n)
    
    Example:
        >>> grid = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
        >>> num_islands(grid)
        2  # Two separate islands
