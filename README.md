## 🛠️ Languages Used
- Python (Primary)
- May add C++/Java in the future

## 📌 Notes

- I try to solve problems with multiple approaches when possible (e.g., brute-force vs optimized).
- Code is structured to be clean and beginner-friendly.
- Some solutions include time and space complexity analysis.

## 🧩 Tags I'm Focusing On

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)

## 📅 Timeline

Started: **1st July 2025**  
Goal: **Daily practice for at least 6 months**
